## Simple Blog

Simple Blog [probably to be renamed] is an answer to the complicated nature of things like Drupal and Wordpress.  The modern CMS has become overencumbered with the sheer number of options and multitude of audiences they are trying to please.  When you try to please everyone, you please no one.  This blog software is focused on the specific needs and purposes that I am trying to achieve with my own blog.  I don't need complicated social-media integration. I don't need highly complicated archival and search systems.  I don't need overly complicated theming tools and systems.  I just need a way to post my short stories so that people can read them.  That is what I have built.

## Notes and Instructions
- The Blog's core navigation is driven by Cateogories.  Create new categories to see navigation start to populate.
- Every post must have a category.
- Optionally, a post may have a Subcategory.
- Posts in Subcategories can be read in a "Reader View" allowing them to be consumed in the order they were published, one post at a time.
- Posts can be viewed by Category, Subcategory, or tag.
- User registration has been disabled as there is no need for readers to have acounts.  To create a new account use the provided artisan command "user:register"
